# HEART-DIAGNOSIS-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview

This project aims at analyzing key insight from patient’s checkup to determine whether they have heart disease using vital checks such as blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, chest pains and cholesterol level.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## Methodology
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and numbers were also replaced with values in fasting blood sugar column (0-False, 1-True) and target column (0-No disease, 1-Disease).

•	Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create dashboards and visual reports to highlight key metrics such as average age by fasting blood sugar, chest pain type by gender, gender distribution, total count by disease     presence and average maximium heart rate.

## Tools
1.	Microsoft Excel for data cleaning
2.	SQL Server for coding
3.	Power BI for creation of dashboard and visualization
   
## Insights and Findings

•	There are 713 Male patients equivalent to 69.6 percent and 312 Female patients which is equivalent to 30.4 percent. Total number of patients is 1025

•	Male patients had average maximum heart rate of 150.83 while female patients had 148.36. 

•	Ratio of average age by fasting blood sugar of Male to Female patients that were positive is 58.7 : 56.4 while for negative is 55.4 : 53.3

•	Finally, 413 (57.92 percent) Male patients were diagnosed with heart diseases while 300 (42.08 percent) were without heart disease and 86 (27.56 percent) Female patients were diagnosed with heart diseases while 226          (72.44 percent) were without heart disease.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that irrespective of gender or age difference, heart disease can develop in any sex and at any age.

Male patients were diagnosed with more heart diseases that the female patients.

## Recommendations
•	Regular checkups at intervals should be carried for both sex to diagnose heart disease on time and commence treatment immediately.

•	Male patients are more prone to contacting heart disease and should be given priority during checkup as they are the most venerable.
